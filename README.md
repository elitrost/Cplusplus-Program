    #Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    This program allows users to access a 12- and a 24-hour clock. The user can choose to add a second, minute, and/or hour to both of the clocks.
    
    #What did you do particularly well?
    THis piece of code has sufficent comments to understand the program, the code follows industry standards, and the program itself looks nice. 
    
    #Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    There are areas in the code that could be more concise. I also feel allowing the users to choose which clock they would like to modify could be benefical instead of having to choose both or neither.
    
    #Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
    I found this piece of code easy to write. I struggled more with succeeding projects that required the use of pointers. Some tools and resources I use while programming are include: resources provided by my teachers, YouTube tutorials, cplusplus.com, and other online resources.
    
    %What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
    Understanding how to create functions will be a skill from this projecct that will be transferable to other projects. 
    
    #How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    Using comments and industry standards healp make this program readable and adaptable.
